In simple terms, a Python dictionary can store pairs of keys and values. Each key is linked to a specific value. Once stored in a dictionary, you can later obtain the value using just the key.\n","\n","For example, consider the Phone lookup where it is very easy and fast to find the phone number(value) when we know the name(Key) associated with it.\n","\n","Also See:\n","\n","Python Dictionary Exercise\n","Python Dictionary Quiz\n","Summary of dictionary operations\n","\n","Dictionaries in Python\n","Characteristics of dictionaries\n","Unordered: The items in dictionaries are stored without any index value, which is typically a range of numbers. They are stored as Key-Value pairs, and the keys are their index, which will not be in any sequence.\n","Unique: As mentioned above, each value has a Key; the Keys in Dictionaries should be unique.  If we store any value with a Key that already exists, then the most recent value will replace the old value.\n","Mutable: The dictionaries are collections that are changeable, which implies that we can add or remove items after the creation.\n","\n","Table of contents\n","Characteristics of dictionaries\n","Creating a dictionary\n","Empty Dictionary\n","Accessing elements of a dictionary\n","Get all keys and values\n","Iterating a dictionary\n","Find a length of a dictionary\n","Adding items to the dictionary\n","Set default value to a key\n","Modify the values of the dictionary keys\n","Removing items from the dictionary\n","Checking if a key exists\n","Join two dictionary\n","Using update() method\n","Using **kwargs to unpack\n","Join two dictionaries having few items in common\n","Copy a Dictionary\n","Copy using the assignment operator\n","Nested dictionary\n","Add multiple dictionaries inside a single dictionary\n","Sort dictionary\n","Dictionary comprehension\n","Python Built-in functions with dictionary\n","max() and min()\n","all()\n","any()\n","When to use dictionaries?\n","Summary of dictionary operations\n","\n","Creating a dictionary\n","There are following three ways to create a dictionary.\n","\n","Using curly brackets: The dictionaries are created by enclosing the comma-separated Key: Value pairs inside the {} curly brackets.
