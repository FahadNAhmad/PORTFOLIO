The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic. The ship had received six warnings of sea ice but was travelling at near maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened five of sixteen compartments to the sea. The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1914), which continues to govern maritime safety.**  \n","*from Wikipedia*"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"ca91678a9dc8cc103a7fbf799a5d903a011334ef","_cell_guid":"e4a1cf77-b695-4ca0-9653-6c41ce2393d8","id":"9-uJFm_zQucr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Imports**"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"d3086cb02907affe5a674b54e4baaedd632482c7","_cell_guid":"998b2a03-c60e-4fd6-9f69-784de6e6c9b8","id":"3-Zw6IuPQucs"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline\n","sns.set()\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\n","#warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\n","#warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","\n","#from subprocess import check_output\n","#print(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"efb595c75201cdb2a53388dc152a8e526e1b921a","_cell_guid":"872b97b2-56fe-4644-a11f-afb00f422169","trusted":true,"id":"ShUxnRkVQucs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682977349663,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":134,"user":{"displayName":"Fahad N Ahmad","userId":"13781716313060204779"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sns.__version__"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"0dabb93c5c6480e69cbc93616932445e614f506f","trusted":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"id":"wDNQuYYQQuct","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682977352486,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":203,"user":{"displayName":"Fahad N Ahmad","userId":"13781716313060204779"}},"outputId":"3ed0c486-c50d-4934-f308-57b13f797af2"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'0.12.2'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FahadNAhmad/DATASETS/master/Titanictrain.csv')\n","df_test = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FahadNAhmad/DATASETS/master/Titanictest.csv')\n"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"0333d5086a63e3870708e7ba7a540d036c53544e","_cell_guid":"080fb327-390d-4124-b287-a561d050fe7e","trusted":true,"id":"Y8i2Y96EQucu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682977558874,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":372,"user":{"displayName":"Fahad N Ahmad","userId":"13781716313060204779"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"13fd8422db7a1ceae9ebb002df452e8293a9ab0c","_cell_guid":"6c7d2500-95b1-4057-98f7-39100e8a6d7f","id":"arfqCszqQucu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train.head()"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"48a2091edbeacc9c23dad6bc0c64d0302d01b87b","_cell_guid":"17a3c0a2-3aad-47f4-be6f-e8756bddf080","trusted":true,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"sxFdOyLVQucu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1682977561546,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":133,"user":{"displayName":"Fahad N Ahmad","userId":"13781716313060204779"}},"outputId":"28ae6d3e-3f8a-447f-980f-2506cc02c3e6"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   PassengerId  Survived  Pclass  \\\n","0            1         0       3   \n","1            2         1       1   \n","2            3         1       3   \n","3            4         1       1   \n","4            5         0       3   \n","\n","                                                Name     Sex   Age  SibSp  \\\n","0                            Braund, Mr. Owen Harris    male  22.0      1   \n","1  Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...  female  38.0      1   \n","2                             Heikkinen, Miss.
